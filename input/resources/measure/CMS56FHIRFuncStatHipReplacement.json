Although THA is an effective procedure for addressing osteoarthritis for many patients, some people, particularly those with more severe preoperative pain and impairment, do not experience the improvements in pain, function, and quality of life expected from the procedure (Beswick et al., 2012; Fortin et al., 1999; Tilbury et al., 2016). In 2010, providers performed 326,100 THAs, with 95 percent of them in patients age 45 and older (Wolford, Palso, &amp; Bercovitz, 2015). Although THAs were introduced as a procedure for older adults, the percentage of patients age 55 to 64 (29 percent) who had a THA in 2010 exceeded the percentage of patients age 75 and older (26 percent) who had a THA (Wolford, Palso, &amp; Bercovitz, 2015). Kurtz et al. (2009) projected that patients younger than 65 would account for 52 percent of THAs by 2030. This growth in hip surgeries for patients younger than 65 is significant because these patients often require more expensive joint arthroplasties that will better withstand the wear caused by physical activity (Bozic et al., 2006). This measure evaluates whether patients complete a patient-reported functional status assessment (FSA) before and after a THA. Measuring functional status for patients undergoing THA permits longitudinal assessment - from the patient's perspective - of the impact of surgical intervention on pain, physical function, as well as health-related quality of life (Rothrock et al., 2010).</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Clinical Recommendation Statement</th>\n\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">While there is no clinical guideline recommending that clinicians assess patients who are undergoing total hip replacements using patient-reported outcomes of function and pain, several clinical specialty societies support the use of a general health questionnaire and a disease-specific questionnaire for these patients. In particular, they recommend the Veterans RAND 12-item health survey (VR-12) or the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS]-10-Global as the general health questionnaire and the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [HOOS], Jr. as the disease-specific questionnaire (American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the American Joint Replacement Registry, The Hip Society, The Knee Society, &amp; the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, 2015). Peer-reviewed and grey literature support additional exclusions for patients undergoing total hip replacements. Staged procedures, concurrent procedures, partial procedures, resurfacing procedures, revision procedures, and removal of implant devices or prosthesis were linked to significant morbidity; complications (such as dislocation, infection, and reinfection); and high failure rates (Ludwick et al., 2021). In addition, mechanical complications, such as instability and dislocation, are also linked to complications and are associated with primary and revision THA/Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) (Gkiatas et al., 2021). Malignant neoplasms (such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head) are associated with substantial pain and functional disabilities before THA/TKA (Bernhard et al., 2021). Additionally, peer-reviewed and grey literature support various postoperative time frames, including follow-up within 10 to 14 months (Franklin et al., 2021) (Holte et al., 2021).</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n\n<tr>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Citation</th>\n\n\n  \n  \n  <td class=\"content-container\">\n    \n    \n    \n    American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the American Joint Replacement Registry, The Hip Society, The Knee Society, &amp; the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons.

This selection of choice types is a superset of the majority of choice types that are used as possible\nrepresentations for timing-valued elements in QICore, allowing this function to be used across any resource.\nThe input can be provided as a DateTime, Quantity, Interval&lt;DateTime&gt; or Interval&lt;Quantity&gt;.\nThe intent of this function is to provide a clear and concise mechanism to treat single\nelements that have multiple possible representations as intervals so that logic doesn't have to account\nfor the variability. More complex calculations (such as medication request period or dispense period\ncalculation) need specific guidance and consideration. That guidance may make use of this function, but\nthe focus of this function is on single element calculations where the semantics are unambiguous.\nIf the input is a DateTime, the result a DateTime Interval beginning and ending on that DateTime.\nIf the input is a Quantity, the quantity is expected to be a calendar-duration interpreted as an Age,\nand the result is a DateTime Interval beginning on the Date the patient turned that age and ending immediately before one year later.\nIf the input is a DateTime Interval, the result is the input.\nIf the input is a Quantity Interval, the quantities are expected to be calendar-durations interpreted as an Age, and the result\nis a DateTime Interval beginning on the date the patient turned the age given as the start of the quantity interval, and ending\nimmediately before one year later than the date the patient turned the age given as the end of the quantity interval.\nIf the input is a Timing, an error will be thrown indicating that Timing calculations are not implemented.

  "rationale": "THAs are common surgical procedures that address hip pain and functional impairment, primarily caused by osteoarthritis. Although THA is an effective procedure for addressing osteoarthritis for many patients, some people, particularly those with more severe preoperative pain and impairment, do not experience the improvements in pain, function, and quality of life expected from the procedure (Beswick et al., 2012; Fortin et al., 1999; Tilbury et al., 2016). In 2010, providers performed 326,100 THAs, with 95 percent of them in patients age 45 and older (Wolford, Palso, \\& Bercovitz, 2015). Although THAs were introduced as a procedure for older adults, the percentage of patients age 55 to 64 (29 percent) who had a THA in 2010 exceeded the percentage of patients age 75 and older (26 percent) who had a THA (Wolford, Palso, \\& Bercovitz, 2015). Kurtz et al. (2009) projected that patients younger than 65 would account for 52 percent of THAs by 2030. This growth in hip surgeries for patients younger than 65 is significant because these patients often require more expensive joint arthroplasties that will better withstand the wear caused by physical activity (Bozic et al., 2006). This measure evaluates whether patients complete a patient-reported functional status assessment (FSA) before and after a THA. Measuring functional status for patients undergoing THA permits longitudinal assessment - from the patient's perspective - of the impact of surgical intervention on pain, physical function, as well as health-related quality of life (Rothrock et al., 2010).\n",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "While there is no clinical guideline recommending that clinicians assess patients who are undergoing total hip replacements using patient-reported outcomes of function and pain, several clinical specialty societies support the use of a general health questionnaire and a disease-specific questionnaire for these patients. In particular, they recommend the Veterans RAND 12-item health survey (VR-12) or the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System \\[PROMIS\\]-10-Global as the general health questionnaire and the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score \\[HOOS\\], Jr. as the disease-specific questionnaire (American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the American Joint Replacement Registry, The Hip Society, The Knee Society, \\& the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, 2015). Peer-reviewed and grey literature support additional exclusions for patients undergoing total hip replacements. Staged procedures, concurrent procedures, partial procedures, resurfacing procedures, revision procedures, and removal of implant devices or prosthesis were linked to significant morbidity; complications (such as dislocation, infection, and reinfection); and high failure rates (Ludwick et al., 2021). In addition, mechanical complications, such as instability and dislocation, are also linked to complications and are associated with primary and revision THA/Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) (Gkiatas et al., 2021). Malignant neoplasms (such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head) are associated with substantial pain and functional disabilities before THA/TKA (Bernhard et al., 2021). Additionally, peer-reviewed and grey literature support various postoperative time frames, including follow-up within 10 to 14 months (Franklin et al., 2021) (Holte et al., 2021).\n",
