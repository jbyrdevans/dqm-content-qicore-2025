Chlamydia infections are often asymptomatic, but, if left untreated, can lead to serious and irreversible complications (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Women are particularly vulnerable when infected with chlamydia. Left untreated, chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to chronic pelvic pain or infertility. Pregnant women may also transmit the infection to their infant, potentially resulting in neonatal pneumonia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Clinical Recommendation Statement</th>\n\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2021) recommends screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women aged 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection (B recommendation)</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n\n<tr>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Citation</th>\n\n\n  \n  \n  <td class=\"content-container\">\n    \n    \n    \n    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The denominator exclusion does not apply to patients who qualify for the initial population (IP) based on services other than the pregnancy test alone. These other services include services for sexually transmitted infections, contraceptives or contraceptive devices and infertility treatments. For example, a patient who has both a pregnancy test and a chlamydia diagnosis, either of which would qualify them for the IP, would not be eligible for this denominator exclusion. This eCQM is a patient-based measure. This FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure:  CMS153v14.

  "description": "Percentage of women 16-24 years of age who were identified as sexually active at any time during the measurement period and who had at least one test for chlamydia during the measurement period",
  "usage": "Codes to identify sexually active women include codes for: pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, contraceptives or contraceptive devices, and infertility treatments. The denominator exclusion does not apply to patients who qualify for the initial population (IP) based on services other than the pregnancy test alone. These other services include services for sexually transmitted infections, contraceptives or contraceptive devices and infertility treatments. For example, a patient who has both a pregnancy test and a chlamydia diagnosis, either of which would qualify them for the IP, would not be eligible for this denominator exclusion. This eCQM is a patient-based measure. This FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure:  CMS153v14. Please refer to the HL7 QI-Core Implementation Guide (https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU6/) for more information on QI-Core and mapping recommendations from QDM to QI-Core STU 6.

  "rationale": "Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the U.S., resulting in roughly 1.7 million cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Chlamydia infections are often asymptomatic, but, if left untreated, can lead to serious and irreversible complications (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2021; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Women are particularly vulnerable when infected with chlamydia. Left untreated, chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to chronic pelvic pain or infertility. Pregnant women may also transmit the infection to their infant, potentially resulting in neonatal pneumonia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).",
