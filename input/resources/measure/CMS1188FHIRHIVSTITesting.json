People with HIV are at an increased risk of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2004). However, early detection and treatment of bacterial STIs in people with HIV can lead to a reduction in HIV transmission (CDC, 2004). Despite guidelines for at least annual screening among sexually active persons with HIV, only an estimated 55 percent received a syphilis test in the past year, 23 percent received a gonorrhea test in the past year, and 24 percent received a chlamydia test in the past year based on a nationally-representative survey of adults with HIV receiving medical care in the United States (Flagg et al., 2015). This measure will help providers focus their attention and quality improvement efforts towards testing and treating sexually transmitted infections in patients with HIV, thus reducing the complications to long-term syphilis infection and reducing STI incidence (Patel et al., 2012).</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Clinical Recommendation Statement</th>\n\n\n<td class=\"content-container\"><p>&quot;Routine serologic screening for syphilis is recommended at least annually for all persons with HIV infection who are sexually active, with more frequent screening (i.e., every 3-6 months) for those who have multiple or anonymous partners&quot; (Panel on Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV, 2022, p. Y-3).</p>\n<p>&quot;Patients undergoing screening or treatment for syphilis also should be evaluated for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea at anatomic sites of exposure in men and for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas in women&quot; (Panel on Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV, 2022, p. Y-3).</p>\n<p>&quot;The [United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)] recommends screening for syphilis in persons who are at increased risk for infection. When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service…. Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established. Men who have sex with men or persons with HIV infection may benefit from screening at least annually or more frequently (e.g., every 3 to 6 months) if they continue to be at high risk&quot; (USPSTF, 2022, p. 1244-1246).</p>\n<p>&quot;At the initial HIV care visit, providers should screen all sexually active persons for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, and perform screening for these infections at least annually during the course of HIV care. Specific testing includes syphilis serology and [a nucleic acid amplification test] NAAT for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis at the anatomic site of exposure&quot; (Workowski et al., 2021, p. 26).</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n\n<tr>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Citation</th>\n\n\n  \n  \n  <td class=\"content-container\">\n    \n    \n    \n    <p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Resources and Services Administration, National Institutes of Health, HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, &amp; HIV Prevention in Clinical Care Working Group.

  "rationale": "The rates of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia cases per 100,000 in the United States have steadily risen over the last decade and increased 11.2 percent, 5.9 percent, and 2.8 percent, respectively, from 2018 to 2019 (National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention \\[NCHHSTP\\], 2021). People with HIV are at an increased risk of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\[CDC\\], 2004). However, early detection and treatment of bacterial STIs in people with HIV can lead to a reduction in HIV transmission (CDC, 2004). Despite guidelines for at least annual screening among sexually active persons with HIV, only an estimated 55 percent received a syphilis test in the past year, 23 percent received a gonorrhea test in the past year, and 24 percent received a chlamydia test in the past year based on a nationally-representative survey of adults with HIV receiving medical care in the United States (Flagg et al., 2015). This measure will help providers focus their attention and quality improvement efforts towards testing and treating sexually transmitted infections in patients with HIV, thus reducing the complications to long-term syphilis infection and reducing STI incidence (Patel et al., 2012).\n",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "\"Routine serologic screening for syphilis is recommended at least annually for all persons with HIV infection who are sexually active, with more frequent screening (i.e., every 3-6 months) for those who have multiple or anonymous partners\" (Panel on Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV, 2022, p. Y-3).\n\n\"Patients undergoing screening or treatment for syphilis also should be evaluated for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea at anatomic sites of exposure in men and for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas in women\" (Panel on Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV, 2022, p. Y-3).\n\n\"The \\[United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)\\] recommends screening for syphilis in persons who are at increased risk for infection. When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service.... Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established. Men who have sex with men or persons with HIV infection may benefit from screening at least annually or more frequently (e.g., every 3 to 6 months) if they continue to be at high risk\" (USPSTF, 2022, p. 1244-1246).\n\n\"At the initial HIV care visit, providers should screen all sexually active persons for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, and perform screening for these infections at least annually during the course of HIV care. Specific testing includes syphilis serology and \\[a nucleic acid amplification test\\] NAAT for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis at the anatomic site of exposure\" (Workowski et al., 2021, p. 26).\n",
